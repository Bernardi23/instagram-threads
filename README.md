# Threads from Instagram flutter remake 

This is a remake of Instagram's new app: Threads, done with flutter.

The app is really well designed with really good user interactivity (responsive and with a lot of simple animations). It took me one day of development to make the Chats page, which is probably the hardest part. This shows how fast you can develop with flutter while maintaining great design and performance. 

**Warning**: I'm not sure how well it'll perform on regular devices since I've only tried on my emulator, but there's a lot of tweaks I can make on the app to make it perform better.
